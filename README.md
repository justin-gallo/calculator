# calculator
A functional hand-calculator built using Javascript. 

Known bugs:
  1) Consecutive operations *without* pressing "equals" evaluate incorrectly. Example: 6 + 12 / 3 = 2, instead of 6. 
  2) It is possible to press multiple operation buttons consecutively. Example: 6 + + - 4

Easter Eggs: 
The answer to 9+10 depends on who you ask.
