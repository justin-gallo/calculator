# calculator
A functional hand-calculator built using Javascript. 

Known bugs:
  1) Consecutive operations *without* pressing "equals" evaluate incorrectly. Example: 6 + 12 / 3 = 2, instead of 6. 
  2) It is possible to press multiple operation buttons consecutively. Example: 6 + + - 4
  3) Pressing the delete key after completing an operation (i.e. hitting "equals") sort of breaks the program. 

Easter Eggs: 
What's 9 plus 10?
