# calculator
A functional hand-calculator built using Javascript. 

Bugs Fixed:
  1) Consecutive operations *without* pressing "equals" now evaluate properly. 
  2) It is now impossible to press multiple operation buttons consecutively. Example: 6 + + - 4
  3) Pressing the delete key after completing an operation (i.e. hitting "equals") no longer works. The delete key is only active when the last button pressed is a number. 

Easter Eggs: 
What's 9 plus 10?
